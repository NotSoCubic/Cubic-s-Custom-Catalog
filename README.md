# Cubic's Custom Catalog
This repository lists all the custom levels I've made for the game, in chronological order of when I've made them. This includes spin-off levels I've made, remakes I've made, collaboration levels I partook in, and of course, levels I made myself.

To add these levels to your EDGE, you need to put the BIN files in the "levels" folder and the ESO files in the "models" folder in the game's local files.
Then you need to go into the "mapping.xml" file (found in the levels folder) and add the string of levels in each file's "mapping.xml" file into the one in the game's files.

If you did everything right, you should see new levels in your game.

If you would like to play older versions of these levels, contact me and I will reach out to you eventually

If you are in the official EDGE Mod Uploading Discord Server, you will gain access to any new levels earlier than their expected release date.
