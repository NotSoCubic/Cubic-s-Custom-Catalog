# Cubic's Custom Catalog
This repository features every custom EDGE level I've made and put out to the public at one point in time. This lists spin-off levels, remakes of already existing levels, levels I built with other people, and of course, levels that I made all by myself. To add new levels to your EDGE, simply place the .bin files into the "levels" folder and the .eso files into the "models folder. Then, add the level strings into the mapping.xml file found in the "levels" folder and place the strings underneath the "standard", "bonus", or "extended" elements (those strings are listed in the readme files provided in the folders of each level.)

Total Level Count: 19

Disclaimer: Any upcoming levels might take more time than expected to be released. I got a MacBook recently and I'm not sure if it can run EdgeTool yet. More updates will be provided in the near future.
